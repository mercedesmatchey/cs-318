            <p>Crafting, which is a type of art, is a great stress reliever and a great way to release many different emotions and channel all your focus into making something beautiful. The journey of crafting is not always the prettiest, embrace the mess and chaos! The bigger the mess, the MORE FUN!</p>

                <h2>Wood Crafts</h2>
                    <p>My mom, Leah, is the master of the Wood Crafts or as she calls them, Wood Crap. Any piece of wood can make the perfect craft. People love the rustic, nature vibes they get from having a wood piece of artwork in their homes! Wood crafts could be something as simple as a bird house outside your home, or something with a painting on it. Build with the wood, paint on the wood, put stickers on the wood, do whatever you want with the wood.</p>

                <h2>Cricut Crafts</h2>
                    <p>Using my Cricut Maker 3 machine has been my new favorite crafting activity. The possibilities are truly endless! From signs to car decals to Christmas ornaments to cutting boards to shirts, really anything you can put it on! It is great having the ability to personalize and create ANYTHING I can think of!!</p>

                <h2>Crochet Crafts</h2>
                    <p>Crocheting is an activity that cannot be duplicated by a machine. That means that humans are the only ones able to create things by the art of crochet. There are so many beautiful creations made by those who crochet! Blankets, Dish Rags, Stuffed Animals, Scrubbies, Clothes, etc. The time require to crochet, usually makes the items more expensive, but the work done is always beautiful. Crocheting can be relaxing and can be a mindless craft. </p>
