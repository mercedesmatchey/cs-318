        <h2>Science Teaching with an Earth and Space Science Emphasis</h2>
        <p>My dream job is owning my own successful business, making crafts and decor.</p>
        <h3>Junior</h3>
        <p>What I hope to get out of this class is the ability to create a functional website for my mom's small business. I help her make things and we have an average size following for our small business but a website would be much better than a Facebook page.</p>
        <h4>My Favorite Things</h4>
        <p>My favorite things are my 1 year old yellow lab, Duke, my family and friends, I enjoy spending my free time crafting, creating, making, and it is a great stress reducer for me. My mom and I live by the rule of, why buy it for $10, when you can make it for $100!</p>
